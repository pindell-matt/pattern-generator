# Pattern Generator

This program is an exercise in creating patterns of variable length.

Users can submit pattern templates of any length, using the format: `XNXXN`
where `X` stands for an uppercase letter A-Z (excluding `I` and `O`) and `N` stands for a digit between 2 and 9.
Patterns are case-insensitive.

Generated patterns can also be evaluated to see the total count of `N` elements that were submitted.
